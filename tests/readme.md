# API Tests

This directory contains the API route tests for our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

## How to Contribute

Please write a new test file for each new route created. This is crucial to maintain the quality and stability of our API.

### Architecture

Follow this architecture for your tests:

*   Create a file named `test_service_name.py` (e.g., `test_auth.py`).
*   Inside this file, add your tests for the different routes of the service.
